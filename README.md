## Background

The [New York Citi Bike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citi_Bike) Program is the largest bike sharing program in the United States. The objective of this project is to generate dashboards for regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.

Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage.

This project, however, only focuses on data from January 2018 to October 2020, which is the more relevant up-to-date period.

## Questions to address

* How many trips have been recorded total during the chosen period?

* How have number of trips changed over stations for starting/ending a journey from Jan 2018 to Oct 2020?
Created a dynamic map that shows how each station's popularity changes over time (by month and year) with an overlaid zip code data.

* In October 2020, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting/ending a journey?

* In October 2020, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting/ending a journey?

* By what percentage has total ridership grown?

* What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during winter/summer months?

* How has the proportion of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed? 

* How has the gender breakdown of participants (Male v. Female) changed over the chosen period?

* How has the proportion of different age groups changed over the timespan?

* What is the average distance in miles that a bike is ridden?

* Which bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection in the timespan?
